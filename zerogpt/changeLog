Settings:
Added “Flexible Optimization Settings.” If you're not sure what you're doing, it’s best not to change anything here!

Performance
Keep-Alive:
Persistent connection support. If you initialize AiClient = Client() once at the beginning and reuse it throughout, subsequent requests are processed faster thanks to TCP connection reuse.

Local Address:
Added the local_address option, which in some cases speeds up DNS resolution and connection setup.

Automatic Retries:
In case of temporary network failures or server errors (e.g., 5xx responses), requests are automatically retried several times, improving reliability.

Pre-warm:
Introduced a mechanism that warms up the API in advance before main requests, reducing the latency of the first response.

RETRY STREAM:
If an error occurs during streaming (stream=True), such as an SSL failure, the client automatically reconnects and retries the request without stopping the main code execution.

RESUME:
Thanks to this feature, the AI continues generating text from where it left off. While there may be occasional hiccups, the output remains coherent and readable.
